# Trace Analysis Tool README

## Overview

This tool is designed to analyze simulation traces, calculating the average read latency and bandwidth at the interface. It takes a trace file containing transaction data and computes relevant metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of Python programming language

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository containing the code.

    ```bash
    https://github.com/sfoorti12/GH-2024-Silicon-Engineering.git
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Trace File**: Ensure you have a trace file in the required format. Each transaction in the trace should be represented as a dictionary with keys: "Timestamp", "TxnType", and optionally "Data" for read and write transactions.

2. **Run the Code**: Execute the Python script, providing the path to your trace file as an argument.

    ```bash
    python gh_2024_silicon_engineering.py
    ```

3. **Interpret Results**: The tool will output the average read latency in cycles and the bandwidth in Bytes/sec based on the provided trace.

## Example

Consider the following trace file format:

```python
trace = [
  {"Timestamp": 0, "TxnType": "Rd", "Data": None},
  {"Timestamp": 10, "TxnType": "Data", "Data": "......."},
  {"Timestamp": 15, "TxnType": "Wr", "Data": None},
  {"Timestamp": 20, "TxnType": "Rd", "TxnType": None},
  {"Timestamp": 32, "TxnType": "Data", "Data": "......."},
  {"Timestamp": 40, "TxnType": "Rd", "TxnType": None},  # Missing response for this read
  {"Timestamp": 50, "TxnType": "Data", "Data": "......."},
]
```

Assuming an operating frequency of 1 GHz, you can run the code as follows:

```bash
python analyze_trace.py example_trace.py
```

## Additional Information

- Ensure your trace file follows the specified format to get accurate results.
- The tool calculates bandwidth based on the assumption of a fixed data width of 32 bits per transaction.
